# Temperature Forecasting
This repository contains a project focused on forecasting temperature based on time series data. The goal of this project is to predict temperature values using two different models: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory).

# Project Overview
In this project, we tackle the task of temperature forecasting using time series analysis techniques. The main steps involved are as follows:

Data Preprocessing: The initial dataset is transformed to handle non-stationary data by applying suitable techniques such as differencing, decomposition, or logarithmic transformation.

Model Comparison: Two models, namely ARIMA and LSTM, are implemented to forecast the temperature values. The models are trained and evaluated based on their performance in terms of accuracy and predictive capabilities.
